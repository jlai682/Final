## Ideas
In Order of Importance:
* It should be able to show sport categories with several exercises or activities that can be used to relieve stress.
* It needs to collect user information to guess potential events the user may have an interest in  
* It could have an option to show different exercises based on the stress levels they have at the given time
* A level of difficulty/experience as a filter for exercises of each sport 

If we have time:
* Some sort of age filter so users can be part of a group of similar age (ie: kid events, adult events)
* It should be able to show events near by 
* It should be able to notify people whenever the website feels the person needs to relax.
* Could have a way to differentiate individual stress exercises and group event?
* How will it guess stress levels?: it will ask how streeful that person feels on a scale of 1 to 10 
* a possible reward system for completing each exercise/event



Should come up with solution statement and find focus.

* We want a website that takes users' personal interests to create healthy, enjoyable, and stress-reducing exercises for all ages and recommend a sample schedule for them.
* Athletic/experienced: running/jogging
* Less experienced: yoga
* Filter by experience, or/and by preferred sport/activity.

Running:
* More experienced: a local 5k
* Less experienced: 10-20 minute
